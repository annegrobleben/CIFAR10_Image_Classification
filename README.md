This notebook is based on an assignment done as part of a Master in Data Science & AI at Nuclio Digital School, it shows how to train a convoluational neural network (CNN) that assigns images in the CIFAR10 dataset from the Keras library to 10 different categories with an accuracy of at least 80% on the test set. The dataset is loaded directly from the Keras library and split into training set, validation set and test set. A total number of six networks are trained throughout this assignment, and the best performing one is used for the final predictions.
